    "To calculate multiple cross-recativity between 2 proteins you can use function Cross_react_predict wich returns a list with distribution of cross-reactivity for each individual. To specify individuals, you can pass as a \"genotype\" argument an object of the class Population and the number of individuals as a \"N_individuals\" argument. You can also pass a list with fixed genotypes as a \"genotype\" argument\n",
